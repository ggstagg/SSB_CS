This repo contains all of the course content for SSB's Computer Science program!

The folder for each day contains a PowerPoint and PDF version of the day's slidedecks (Note: you will need to use the PowerPoint version for the animations to work; the PDF is really more of a backup).

Said folders also include a .ipynb and .py version of the day's practice problems (these are meant to be used in Google Colab; the .py files are, again, backups).

Feel free to reach out for questions, comments, or concerns!
